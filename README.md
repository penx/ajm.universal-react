# ajm.universal-react (Universal React Template)

For a development build on port 8080, with livereload, run `npm run wds` at the same time as one of `npm run start:dev`, `npm run start:watch` (watch and reload on changes), `npm run start:debug` (allow a debugger to be attached) or `npm run start:break` (await debugger to be attached).

For a production build on port 80, run `npm run build` then `npm run docker` then `npm run docker:start`.
